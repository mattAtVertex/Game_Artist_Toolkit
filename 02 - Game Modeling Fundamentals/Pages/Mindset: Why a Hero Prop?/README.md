# Mindset: Why a Hero Prop?

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Over the next 2 sprints, we're going to be working on a Hero Prop. Then, we're going to bring it into a nature scene in Unreal Engine. But why? Well, let's break it down...</p>
<h3>Why a Hero Prop?</h3>
<p>There are a few reasons why building a hero prop at this stage is important:</p>
<ol>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Deadline</li>
<li>Scope</li>
<li>Fit</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>SPEED</strong></h4>
<p>To be successful as an environment artist, you need to be able to model and texture at ludicrous speeds. Typically, you would have 3-4 work days (20-30 hours) as a junior artist to in a job to create a prop of this nature. The more you can practice and develop your speed, the better you'll be.</p>
<p><strong>Art Tests:</strong> When receiving an art test for a job, you'll typically have 10-14 days to complete an entire environment. They usually give you 48-72 hours to complete a prop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>DEADLINE</strong></h4>
<p>Another point of this exercise is to get you used to working in deadlines. The schedule is extended, so ultimately you 2 full sprints to work on this. But you NEED to be done with all of your modeling by the end of Sprint 1 and all of your texturing by the end of Sprint 2. These are your deadlines. Meet them and you can celebrate. Miss them and we're in big trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Art Tests:</strong> They give you an art test in an email with a link to the brief. The second you click on the link, the 48 hour timer starts. If you miss the deadline by even 1 second, you're disqualified and you will not be considered for the job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>SCOPE</strong></h4>
<p>Scope refers to the amount of work required compared to your ability to complete it. This exercise is about learning what you are capable of and managing your own scope. Pick something that you can actually complete within the deadline. Challenging yourself is good, but don't bite off more than you can chew. The hard truth here is that your scope management is now your responsibility. If you bite off more than you can chew and realize halfway through the week that you can't finish the modeling portion by the end of the week, then you have four options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Dial it Back:</strong> Find a way to either make it easier. There are always shortcuts you can take and still get a quality product.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pivot:</strong> Change to something easier. You'll usually get a better result if you just dial the original scope back some, but if there is no way, then try something easier that you know you can get done. The earlier you make this decision, the better.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work Overtime:</strong> Cancel that date, turn off Netflix, skip the raid, take a sick day from work, give up some sleep... whatever it takes to get it done.</li>
<li>
<strong>Quit:</strong> Stop working on it, give up your dreams, do not pass go, do not collect $200, and go home.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine, the easier option is to pick something you can reasonably achieve within the 2 week timeline for modeling and texturing.</p>
<p><strong>Art Tests:</strong> The scope they give you is always reasonable for what level of speed and skill they need for the position you are applying for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>FIT</strong></h4>
<p>Finally, one of the biggest reasons you want to work on a hero prop at this stage is to make sure that you can successfully create something that "fits" in a scene. We'll be bringing these props into the nature scene we created in Sprint 1. We want to make sure it looks like it belongs in the scene and is believable.</p>
