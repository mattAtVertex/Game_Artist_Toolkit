# Method: Environment Artist's ZBrush Toolkit

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><span>ZBrush can be a powerful ally to the environment artist, but the way we use it can often times be quite different from the way a character artist uses it. Most of our primary workflow involves starting from base meshes we create externally and adding further detail on to them.</span></p>

<p>The brushes below are great tools in an Environment Artist's toolbelt. For many, the below brushes account for over 80% of time spent in ZBrush creating art for environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim Dynamic - Great for cutting away big chunks</li>
<li>Trim Smooth Border - The golden tool, used for damaging edges</li>
<li>Hard Polish - Used for sharpening hard edges</li>
<li>Clay Tubes - Great for digging in and great for building up form</li>
<li>Dam Standard - Used for making cuts</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="entry-title">SAVING YOUR WORK</h2>
</header>
<div class="entry-content">
<p><a href="http://docs.pixologic.com/getting-started/basic-concepts/saving-your-work/">Excerpt from ZBrush Documentation</a></p>
<p>When you are working you are sure to want to save your creations. That’s when it’s important to remember the difference between the canvas document and your 3D models. The document can only contain 2.5D pixols, and so does not contain the full 3D data of a model. So if you are working on a 3D model and save the document, only a pixol version of the model in its current view is saved. That’s no good if you want to continue sculpting next session. You must save your 3D model through the Tool palette. You can also save all of your ZTools at once by using ZBrush's Project feature. (See below.)</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saving the <strong>Document</strong> will save the canvas 2.5D content only. This is used for illustrations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Saving the <strong>ZTool</strong> will save the selected 3D object (including all its subtools, subdivisions, settings, 3D layers, etc.). This is used for models.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Saving a <strong>Project</strong> will save multiple ZTools at once. It results in a much larger file size and so is not a good choice for saving on multiple versions of a single ZTool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most users will save the ZTools and not the Documents if they are using ZBrush only for its 3D features.</p>
