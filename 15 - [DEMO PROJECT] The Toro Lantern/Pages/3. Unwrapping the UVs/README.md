# 3. Unwrapping the UVs

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>It's UV time! For this objective, we're going to tackle the UVs for our Toro Lantern and optimize them in the best way we can.&nbsp; We'll start by unwrapping everything, then we'll take a closer look at optimizing our layout to get the most out of our texture space. We'll have brief discussions about Texel Density and we'll examine some details about texture space optimization.</p>
