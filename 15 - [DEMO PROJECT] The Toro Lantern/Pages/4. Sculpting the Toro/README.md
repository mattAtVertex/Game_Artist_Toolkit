# 4. Sculpting the Toro

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this video, we're going to go through the sculpting process on the Toro Lantern. We'll start with the foundation where we'll be tackling large form shapes, moving up the mesh to define stone edge detail, and then working our way to sculpting out the wooden roof tiles.</p>

<h2>Notes&nbsp; When Sculpting</h2>
<h3>General Advice</h3>
<ul>
<li>When sculpting something made up of multiple pieces physically, like a brick wall, stone foundation, or tiled roof, remember to treat each brick/block/tile as its own object with its own history, but don't forget to consider how they affect each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Masking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use Ctrl to draw a mask</li>
<li>Ctrl + click outside of the mesh to invert the mask</li>
<li>Ctrl + Drag outside of the mesh to clear the mask</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Considerations for the Foundation</h3>
<p>Below are notes to consider when sculpting the foundation</p>
<ol>
<li>Individual History - Each block has its own history</li>
<li>Weight on the Shoulders - The weight of the Toro bearing down on the blocks causes stress to the foundation</li>
<li>Gradients - Gradients are a major part of the texturing phase but we can also start to consider gradient detail in the sculpting phase as well</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
<ol>
<li>Be mindful of silhouette</li>
<li>Pay attention to shape language</li>
<li>Don't waste time on hidden areas that will never be seen</li>
</ol>
