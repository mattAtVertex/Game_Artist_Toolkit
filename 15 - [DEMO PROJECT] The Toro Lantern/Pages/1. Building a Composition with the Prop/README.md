# 1. Building a Composition with the Prop

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>With our Lantern in Engine, we can start thinking about how to use the Toro Lantern in our scene and build a composition with it.</p>

<h2>Composition</h2>
<h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
<p>The <strong>Rule of Thirds</strong> is one of the most prized elements of image composition. There are many different options for compositional layouts, but one of the easiest is to approach a new scene with is to focus on the "<strong>thirds points</strong>." These thirds points are the 4 corners of the center square in a 3x3 grid. This is one of the easiest approaches to image composition because the eyes are naturally drawn to those areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the image below, you can see the two focal point in this scene we're building out and how each one sits firmly on a thirds point.</p>

<h3>Multiple Angles</h3>
<p>It's always good to have more than one angle. One of the best approaches to this is to focus on one compositional angle first. This will be your <strong>Primary Beauty Shot</strong>. Once you get the camera figured out to a point that you like it, you'll typically find yourself moving some set dressing pieces around in contribution to a more flattering composition.</p>
<p>Once you're satisfied with the main camera shot, the next step is finding a secondary camera shot that looks great. The secret here is to find a camera angle that looks good without changing any set dressing that can be seen from the main beauty camera angle. This is typically much easier to do than you might assume. This will be your <strong>Secondary Beauty Shot</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>A tip on the Secondary Beauty Shot</strong>: I often like to approach my secondary from a complimentary composition. Notice in the two camera angles above, the first one has the Toro Lantern (our primary focal point) on the left of the image, where the second one has the Toro Lantern on the right.</p>
