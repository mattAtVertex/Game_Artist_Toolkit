# 4. Baking the Toro Lantern

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>With the high poly, low poly, and UVs all finished. It's time to bake! In this video, we're going to set up our high and low resolution meshes for export, including setting up Material IDs, and then baking them in Substance Painter. By the end of this step, we'll be ready to start texturing our Toro Lantern in the next module.</p>
