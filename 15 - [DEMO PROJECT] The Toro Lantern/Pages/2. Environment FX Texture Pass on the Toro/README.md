<h2>Notes for the Environment and Usage Pass</h2>
<p>Think about the environment your prop will be in and has been in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When deciding how to do your environment pass, ask yourself these questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What environment does this prop exist in?</li>
<li>How long has it been there?</li>
<li>What kind of wear and tear would happen to the prop in this environment?</li>
<li>What was the weather like and how would that affect the prop over time?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When deciding on your usage pass, ask yourself these questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What is the primary mode of use and how does that use affect the prop over time?</li>
<li>How often was this prop used?</li>
<li>How much time passed between the last time it was used and today?</li>
</ol>
