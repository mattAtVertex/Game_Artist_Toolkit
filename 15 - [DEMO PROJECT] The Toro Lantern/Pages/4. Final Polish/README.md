# 4. Final Polish

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We finished the scene with our perfect composition, lighting and VFX that we like, our hero prop in the focal point..... Now it's time to take the next step: Final Polish.</p>
<p>This is a 3 step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get your scene as closed to finish as possible to a point where you are really happy with it.</li>
<li>Most important part: Sleep on it!</li>
<li>Come back with fresh eyes and do a final polish pass.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this video we're going to break down the final polish pass of the Toro Lantern scene and compare with the previous iteration.</p>
