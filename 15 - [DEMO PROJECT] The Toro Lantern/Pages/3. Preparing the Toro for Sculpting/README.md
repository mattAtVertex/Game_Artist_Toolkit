# 3. Preparing the Toro for Sculpting

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Before we can start sculpting on our Toro Lantern, we need to get it exported out of Maya and set up properly in ZBrush.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Combine objects that make sense in categories. For example, all of the bottom bricks can be mesh combined and exported as one object. We can then polygroup them inside of ZBrush.</li>
<li>Use Auto Groups in the Polygroup menu to polygroup by geometry. In the Brick example, the bricks are all one Sub Tool, but each brick belongs to a separate polygroup. This way you can sculpt on them separately.</li>
<li>Shift + Ctrl + Click to isolate select a polygroup</li>
<li>Think about where you can reuse. For the Toro Lantern, we are only sculpting on one side of the roof. Back in Maya, we can just duplicate and rotate this around to act as the other 3 sides. This could be a repeated element in the texture, or we could even just duplicate the sculpted roof and treat the low poly roof sides as unique. Even though the sculpt is the same, variance in texture will still break up repetition and we have saved a significant amount of time by only sculpting on one side.</li>
