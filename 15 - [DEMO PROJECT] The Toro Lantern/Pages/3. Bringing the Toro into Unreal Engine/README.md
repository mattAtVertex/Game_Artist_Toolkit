# 3. Bringing the Toro into Unreal Engine

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>It's time to bring our fully textured Toro Lantern into the engine. In this video we're going to cover exporting, importing, and setting up materials. We'll also cover setting up a Blueprint, which can be useful for props that might need multiple pieces or lights associated with them.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>In this video, we'll be following the below process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Combining the Low Poly geometry into one game-ready mesh and exporting it for use.</li>
<li>Next, we'll import the mesh and its textures into Unreal.&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>Don't forget to set the ORM's compression settings to "Masks."</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>We'll make use of our Standard ORM master material to set up the material for the Toro Lantern.</li>
<li>We'll create a Blueprint Actor to add the Toro and an associated light to.</li>
