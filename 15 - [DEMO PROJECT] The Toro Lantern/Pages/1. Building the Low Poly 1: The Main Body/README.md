# 1. Building the Low Poly 1: The Main Body

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Once we are finished sculpting our prop and it's time to move on to the low poly. The first thing we need to do is get our high poly out of ZBrush. We want to use Decimation Master to shrink our polycount down to a size that Maya can handle so we can use the sculpt as the basis for building our low poly shell around. Then we're going to start building out the low poly with a focus on the main body.</p>
