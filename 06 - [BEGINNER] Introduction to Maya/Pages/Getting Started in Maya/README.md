# Getting Started in Maya

<p>Welcome to the Introduction to Maya Pre Course. This video series is geared toward those who have either never opened Maya before or need a beginner recap on how to get up and running. The goal is to get you familiarized with the Maya interface and some of the common tools and concepts we will be covering throughout the Game Arts Program. Not only is this a primer for Maya but also acts as a quick guide on the common tools to refer back to while you get accustomed to using the software.</p>
